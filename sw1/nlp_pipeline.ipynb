      "['[Emma by Jane Austen 1816]\\n\\nVOLUME I\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\\nand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings\\nof existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world\\nwith very little to distress or vex her.', \"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period.\", 'Her mother\\nhad died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\\nremembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied\\nby an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\\nof a mother in affection.', \"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,\\nless as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,\\nbut particularly of Emma.\", 'Between _them_ it was more the intimacy\\nof sisters.', \"Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;\\nhighly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by\\nher own.\", \"The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments.\", 'The danger, however, was at present\\nso unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her.', 'Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.', \"It was Miss\\nTaylor's loss which first brought grief.\", 'It was on the wedding-day\\nof this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance.', 'The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\\nher father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening.', 'Her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost.', 'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.', \"Mr. Weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\\nand pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.\", 'The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.', 'She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\\nyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood.', \"A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their\\nbeing left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\", 'She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\\nwell-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\\ninterested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\\nin every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault.', 'How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,\\nand a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\\nnatural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude.', 'She dearly loved her father, but he\\nwas no companion for her.', 'He could not meet her in conversation,\\nrational or playful.', 'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\\nof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time.', 'Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\\nbeing settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond\\nher daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must\\nbe struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next\\nvisit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,\\nto fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.', 'Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\\nand name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.', 'The Woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there.', 'All looked up to them.', 'She had\\nmany acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\\nTaylor for even half a day.', 'It was a melancholy change; and Emma\\ncould not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\\ntill her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.', 'His spirits required support.', 'He was a nervous man, easily depressed;\\nfond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\\nhating change of every kind.', \"Matrimony, as the origin of change,\\nwas always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\\nhe was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.\", 'Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\n\\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.', 'What a pity it\\nis that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"', '\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.', 'Mr. Weston is such\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us\\nfor ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?\"', '\"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?', 'This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,\\nmy dear.\"', '\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see\\nus!--We shall be always meeting!', '_We_ must begin; we must go and pay\\nwedding visit very soon.\"', '\"My dear, how am I to get so far?', 'Randalls is such a distance.', 'I could not walk half so far.\"', '\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.', 'We must go in the carriage,\\nto be sure.\"', '\"The carriage!', 'But James will not like to put the horses to for\\nsuch a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we\\nare paying our visit?\"', '\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston\\'s stable, papa.', 'You know we\\nhave settled all that already.', 'We talked it all over with Mr. Weston\\nlast night.', \"And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like\\ngoing to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.\", 'I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.', 'That was\\nyour doing, papa.', 'You got Hannah that good place.', 'Nobody thought\\nof Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"', '\"I am very glad I did think of her.', 'It was very lucky, for I would\\nnot have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;\\nand I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\\npretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.', 'Whenever I see her,\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.', 'I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see.', 'Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,\\nshe will be hearing of us.', 'He will be able to tell her how we\\nall are.\"', 'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,\\nand hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.', 'The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.', \"Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.\", 'He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,\\nand always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.', \"He had\\nreturned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked\\nup to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.\", 'It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.', 'Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;\\nand his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and her children were\\nanswered most satisfactorily.', 'When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse\\ngratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come\\nout at this late hour to call upon us.', 'I am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk.\"', '\"Not at all, sir.', 'It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild\\nthat I must draw back from your great fire.\"', '\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.', 'I wish you may\\nnot catch cold.\"', '\"Dirty, sir!', 'Look at my shoes.', 'Not a speck on them.\"', '\"Well!', 'that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here.', 'It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast.', 'I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"', '\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.', 'Being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry\\nwith my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.', 'How did you all behave?', 'Who cried most?\"', '\"Ah!', 'poor Miss Taylor!', '\\'Tis a sad business.\"', '\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly\\nsay `poor Miss Taylor.\\'', 'I have a great regard for you and Emma;\\nbut when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At\\nany rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.\"', '\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!\"', 'said Emma playfully.', '\"That is what you have in your head,\\nI know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"', '\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwith a sigh.', '\"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"', '\"My dearest papa!', 'You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose\\nMr. Knightley to mean _you_.', 'What a horrible idea!', 'Oh no!', 'I meant\\nonly myself.', 'Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--\\nin a joke--it is all a joke.', 'We always say what we like to one another.\"', 'Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see\\nfaults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,\\nshe knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would\\nnot have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being\\nthought perfect by every body.', '\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I\\nmeant no reflection on any body.', 'Miss Taylor has been used\\nto have two persons to please; she will now have but one.', 'The chances are that she must be a gainer.\"', '\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear\\nabout the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all\\nbehaved charmingly.', 'Every body was punctual, every body in their\\nbest looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.', 'Oh no;\\nwe all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,\\nand were sure of meeting every day.\"', '\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father.', '\"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,\\nand I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"', 'Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.', '\"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\"\\nsaid Mr. Knightley.', '\"We should not like her so well as we do, sir,\\nif we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to\\nMiss Taylor\\'s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,\\nat Miss Taylor\\'s time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,\\nand how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,\\nand therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.', 'Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily\\nmarried.\"', '\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma,\\n\"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.', 'I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,\\nand be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again, may comfort me for any thing.\"', 'Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.', 'Her father fondly replied,\\n\"Ah!', 'my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,\\nfor whatever you say always comes to pass.', 'Pray do not make any\\nmore matches.\"', '\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,\\nfor other people.', 'It is the greatest amusement in the world!', 'And\\nafter such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would\\nnever marry again.', 'Oh dear, no!', 'Mr. Weston, who had been a widower\\nso long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,\\nso constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\\nfriends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--\\nMr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\\nnot like it.', 'Oh no!', 'Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.', 'Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,\\nand others of the son and the uncle not letting him.', 'All manner\\nof solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none\\nof it.', '\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I\\nmet with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,\\nhe darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas\\nfor us from Farmer Mitchell\\'s, I made up my mind on the subject.', 'I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed\\nme in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave\\noff match-making.\"', '\"I do not understand what you mean by `success,\\'\" said Mr. Knightley.', '\"Success supposes endeavour.', 'Your time has been properly and\\ndelicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four\\nyears to bring about this marriage.', \"A worthy employment for a young\\nlady's mind!\", \"But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,\\nas you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself\\none idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor\\nif Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself\\nevery now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?\", 'Where\\nis your merit?', 'What are you proud of?', 'You made a lucky guess;\\nand _that_ is all that can be said.\"', '\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--\\nI pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky\\nguess is never merely luck.', 'There is always some talent in it.', \"And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not\\nknow that I am so entirely without any claim to it.\", 'You have drawn\\ntwo pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something\\nbetween the do-nothing and the do-all.', \"If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's\\nvisits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed\\nmany little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.\", 'I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.\"', '\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\nown concerns.', 'You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,\\nthan good to them, by interference.\"', '\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\"\\nrejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.', '\"But, my dear,\\npray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up\\none\\'s family circle grievously.\"', '\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.', 'Poor Mr. Elton!', 'You\\nlike Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him.', 'There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him--and he has been\\nhere a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably,\\nthat it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought\\nwhen he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if\\nhe would like to have the same kind office done for him!', 'I think\\nvery well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing\\nhim a service.\"', '\"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very\\ngood young man, and I have a great regard for him.', 'But if you\\nwant to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come\\nand dine with us some day.', 'That will be a much better thing.', 'I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.\"', '\"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr. Knightley,\\nlaughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much\\nbetter thing.', 'Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best\\nof the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.', 'Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care\\nof himself.\"', 'CHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property.', 'He had received a good education, but,\\non succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become\\nindisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\\nwere engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social\\ntemper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.', 'Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances\\nof his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,\\nof a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love\\nwith him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,\\nwho had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,\\nwhich the connexion would offend.', 'Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command\\nof her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamily-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it\\ntook place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,\\nwho threw her off with due decorum.', 'It was an unsuitable connexion,\\nand did not produce much happiness.', 'Mrs. Weston ought to have found\\nmore in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\\nmade him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\\nof being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,\\nshe had not the best.', \"She had resolution enough to pursue\\nher own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain\\nfrom unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,\\nnor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\", 'They lived beyond\\ntheir income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:\\nshe did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once\\nto be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.', \"Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst\\nof the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,\\nhe was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\", 'From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.', \"The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering\\nillness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,\\nnor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to\\ntake the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.\", 'Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed\\nto have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,\\nthe child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,\\nand he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to\\nimprove as he could.', 'A complete change of life became desirable.', 'He quitted the militia\\nand engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a\\ngood way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.', 'It was a concern which brought just employment enough.', 'He had still\\na small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;\\nand between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,\\nthe next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.', 'He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure\\nthe purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had\\nalways longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even\\nas Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own\\nfriendly and social disposition.', 'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence\\nhis schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\\non youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling\\ntill he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long\\nlooked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects\\nin view, till they were accomplished.', 'He had made his fortune,\\nbought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new\\nperiod of existence, with every probability of greater happiness\\nthan in any yet passed through.', 'He had never been an unhappy man;\\nhis own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;\\nbut his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly\\namiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof\\nof its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\\nto excite gratitude than to feel it.', \"He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was\\nhis own;

and she had lived long enough\\nto know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only\\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\\nfor her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.', \"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,\\nwithout pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering\\nan hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear\\nEmma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation\\nthan most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,\\nand spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\\nthrough its little difficulties and privations.\", \"And then there was\\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,\\nso convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's\\ndisposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching\\nseason no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\\nweek together.\", \"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\\nto Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret;

be rather a dead weight than otherwise;\\nbut for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\\nthat was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.', 'In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.', 'Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--\\nnot like

'Their intercourse was painful\\nenough by letter.', 'How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!', 'Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,\\nwithout reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\\nher style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\\nIt might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.', \"She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\\nwithout resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\", 'Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.',

fortnight; she was\\nto be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,\\nit was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.\", \"Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr.

attend to any thing Jane might communicate.', 'She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had\\nnot been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor\\nJane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,\\nthough all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--\\nThe fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured\\nof their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--\\nShe heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor\\nMiss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard\\nnothing but the instant reply of, \"Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment\\nafterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly\\nforward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--\\nEmma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.', 'There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every\\nthing which her countenance or manner could ever

expression of her face;\\nand while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing\\nto attend to the good old lady\\'s replies, she saw her with a sort\\nof anxious parade of mystery fold up

other time, you know.', 'You and I shall\\nnot want opportunities.', 'And, in fact, you have heard all the\\nessential already.', 'I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits\\nour apology, and

it could not often proceed beyond a look.', 'Mr. Elton made his appearance.', 'His lady greeted him with some\\nof her sparkling vivacity.', '\"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--\\nBut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.', 'You knew I should not stir till my lord and master

Smith.', 'My friend Robert could not resist.', 'They called for him in their way;\\nwere all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with\\nthem the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit\\n(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;\\nand certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,\\nas happy even as he is deserving.', \"He came down by yesterday's coach,\\nand was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report\\nhis proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.\", 'This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.', 'Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--\\nShe will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman\\'s\\nlanguage can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only\\nin the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin\\'s heart seemed\\nfor _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention,\\nwithout its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\\nbox at Astley\\'s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley\\nand little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\\nrather uneasy.\"', 'He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.', 'To speak,\\nshe was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree\\nof happiness.', 'She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.', 'Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,\\nhe added,\\n\\n\"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make\\nyou unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.', 'His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies\\nyour friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better\\nof him as you know him more.', 'His good sense and good principles would\\ndelight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your\\nfriend in better hands.', 'His rank in society I would alter if I could,\\nwhich is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me\\nabout William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\"', 'He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself\\nnot to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\\n\\n\"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.', 'I think\\nHarriet is doing extremely well.', '_Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_.', 'In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.', 'I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.', 'You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me!', 'how peculiarly\\nunprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more\\ndetermined against him, much more, than she was before.\"', '\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley;\\n\"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,\\nnot likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told\\nher he loved her.\"', 'Emma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word,\\nI believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,\\nare you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright\\n_accepted_ him.', 'I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--\\nDid not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;\\nof business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,\\nin the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not\\nHarriet\\'s hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some\\nfamous ox.\"', 'The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\\nRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma\\'s feelings,\\nand so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently\\npassed on Harriet\\'s side, so fresh the sound of those words,\\nspoken with such emphasis, \"No, I hope I know better than to think\\nof Robert Martin,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence\\nto prove, in some measure, premature.', 'It could not be otherwise.', '\"Do you dare say this?\"', 'cried Mr. Knightley.', '\"Do you dare to suppose\\nme so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--\\nWhat do you deserve?\"', '\"Oh!', 'I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put\\nup with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,\\ndirect answer.', 'Are you quite sure that you understand the terms\\non which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?\"', '\"I am quite sure,\" he replied, speaking very distinctly, \"that he\\ntold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,\\nnothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you\\na proof that it must be so.', 'He asked my opinion as to what he\\nwas now to do.', 'He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he\\ncould apply for information of her relations or friends.', 'Could I\\nmention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?', 'I assured him that I could not.', 'Then, he said, he would endeavour\\nto see her in the course of this day.\"', '\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\\n\"and most sincerely wish them happy.\"', '\"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\"', '\"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\"', '\"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\\nHarriet\\'s good qualities.', \"I have taken some pains for your sake,\\nand for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe\\nas much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.\", 'I have often talked to her a good deal.', 'You must have seen that\\nI did.', 'Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me\\nof pleading poor Martin\\'s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\\nmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\\nwith very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing\\nher happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--\\nMuch of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.\"', '\"Me!\"', 'cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah!', 'poor Harriet!\"', 'She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little\\nmore praise than she deserved.', 'Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of\\nher father.', 'She was not sorry.', 'She wanted to be alone.', 'Her mind\\nwas in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her\\nto be collected.', 'She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;\\nand till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed\\nand reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.', \"Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put\\nthe horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;\\nand she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\", 'The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations\\nmay be imagined.', \"The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the\\nprospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming\\ntoo happy for security.--What had she to wish for?\", 'Nothing, but to\\ngrow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been\\never so superior to her own.', 'Nothing, but that the lessons\\nof her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.', 'Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;\\nand yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst\\nof them.', 'She must laugh at such a close!', 'Such an end of the doleful\\ndisappointment of five weeks back!', 'Such a heart--such a Harriet!', 'Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would\\nbe a pleasure.', 'It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.', 'High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,\\nwas the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\\nMr. Knightley would soon be over.', 'The disguise, equivocation,\\nmystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.', 'She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.', 'In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;\\nnot always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;\\nand, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable\\npersuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,\\nor poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.', 'They arrived.--Mrs.', 'Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--\\nbut hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse\\nreceived the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse\\nwas caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.', '\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston.', '\"I was just\\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\\nthis morning.', 'He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been\\npersuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\"', 'In half a minute they were in the room.', 'Emma was extremely glad\\nto see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of\\nembarrassing recollections on each side.', 'They met readily and smiling,\\nbut with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;\\nand having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank\\nin the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,\\nwhich she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,\\nand of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.', 'When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby\\nwas fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--\\nor of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her\\nand say,\\n\\n\"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving\\nmessage in one of Mrs. Weston\\'s letters.', 'I hope time has not made\\nyou less willing to pardon.', 'I hope you do not retract what you\\nthen said.\"', '\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least.', 'I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give\\nyou joy in person.\"', 'He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.', '\"Is not she looking well?\"', 'said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.', '\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and\\nMrs. Weston doat upon her.\"', 'But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,\\nafter mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named\\nthe name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced\\nin her hearing.', '\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"', '\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.', 'But is it\\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.', 'Early, I know,\\nyou had none.\"', '\"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\"', '\"That appears quite wonderful.', 'I was once very near--and I wish I had--\\nit would have been better.', 'But though I was always doing wrong things,\\nthey were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--\\nIt would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond\\nof secrecy and told you every thing.\"', '\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.', '\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle\\'s being persuaded\\nto pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.', 'When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,\\nand continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,\\nI am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--\\nTill this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.', 'Do not you pity me?\"', 'Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession\\nof gay thought, he cried,\\n\\n\"Ah!', 'by the bye,\" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for\\nthe moment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\"', 'He paused.--She coloured\\nand laughed.--\"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember\\nmy wish in your favour.', 'Let me return your congratulations.--\\nI assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest\\nand satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.\"', 'Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;\\nbut his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his\\nown Jane, and his next words were,\\n\\n\"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness!', 'such delicacy!--\\nand yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.', 'It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--\\na most distinguishing complexion!', 'So peculiarly the lady in it.--\\nJust colour enough for beauty.\"', '\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but do not\\nI remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--\\nWhen we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"', '\"Oh!', 'no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\"\\n\\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could\\nnot help saying,\\n\\n\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,\\nyou had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--\\nI am sure it was a consolation to you.\"', '\"Oh!', 'no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?', 'I was the most miserable wretch!\"', '\"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.', 'I am sure it\\nwas a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking\\nus all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell\\nyou the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself\\nin the same situation.', 'I think there is a little likeness between us.\"', 'He bowed.', '\"If not in our dispositions,\" she presently added, with a look of\\ntrue sensibility, \"there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny\\nwhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior\\nto our own.\"', '\"True, true,\" he answered, warmly.', '\"No, not true on your side.', 'You can\\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.', 'Look at her.', 'Is not she an angel in every gesture?', 'Observe the turn\\nof her throat.', \"Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--\\nYou will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)\\nthat my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels.\", 'They are to be\\nnew set.', 'I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.', 'Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair?\"', '\"Very beautiful, indeed,\" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,\\nthat he gratefully burst out,\\n\\n\"How delighted I am to see you again!', 'and to see you in such\\nexcellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.', 'I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\"', \"The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an\\naccount of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,\\nfrom the infant's appearing not quite well.\", 'She believed she had\\nbeen foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half\\na minute of sending for Mr. Perry.', 'Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,\\nbut Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,\\nhowever, the child had been perfectly well again.', 'This was\\nher history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwho commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,\\nand only regretted that she had not done it.', '\"She should always send\\nfor Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,\\nwere it only for a moment.', 'She could not be too soon alarmed,\\nnor send for Perry too often.', 'It was a pity, perhaps, that he\\nhad not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\\nvery well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry\\nhad seen it.\"', 'Frank Churchill caught the name.', '\"Perry!\"', \"said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\\nFairfax's eye.\", '\"My friend Mr. Perry!', 'What are they saying\\nabout Mr.', 'Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does\\nhe travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?\"', \"Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined\\nin the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she\\ntoo was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\", '\"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!\"', 'he cried.', '\"I can never think\\nof it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.', 'I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.', 'Look at her.', 'Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage\\nof her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--\\nthat the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to\\nnothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?\"', 'Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile\\npartly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,\\nlow, yet steady voice,\\n\\n\"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--\\nThey _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\"', \"He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;\\nbut Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on\\nleaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men,\\nshe felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,\\nand really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never\\nbeen more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character.\", 'The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.', 'CHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,\\na momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured\\nof her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept\\nanother man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she\\nhad to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.', 'A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no\\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,\\nthan she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--\\nthat Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.', \"Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,\\nand self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die\\naway with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\\nand with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\\nher friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of\\nthat nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--\\nHarriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\\nAstley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all\\nwith the utmost delight.\", 'But what did such particulars explain?--\\nThe fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had\\nalways liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had\\nbeen irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible\\nto Emma.', \"The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her\\nfresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.\", 'She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford\\nher the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent\\nenough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood\\nof gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--\\nIt was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many\\na gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for\\nMr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr.', 'Elton!--\\nThe stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,\\nwould have been a stain indeed.', \"No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was\\ntreated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became\\nacquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,\\nshe fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth\\nwhich could bid fairest for her little friend.\", \"She had no doubt\\nof Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,\\nand in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,\\nof security, stability, and improvement.\", 'She would be placed in the\\nmidst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;\\nretired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.', 'She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.', 'She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be\\nthe luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and\\npersevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,\\nto yield only to herself.', 'Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--\\nThe intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must\\nchange into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought\\nto be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,\\nnatural manner.', 'Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,\\nas no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood\\nbefore them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she\\nscarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the\\naltar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,\\nthe latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.', 'Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.', 'The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,\\nby Emma and Mr.', \"Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage\\nought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,\\nto allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,\\nwhich was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,\\nwere agreed in approving it.\", 'But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse\\nto be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their\\nmarriage but as a distant event.', 'When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they\\nwere almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--\\nHe began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--\\na very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.', 'Still, however, he was not happy.', \"Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,\\nthat his daughter's courage failed.\", 'She could not bear to see\\nhim suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though\\nher understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the\\nMr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress\\nwould be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.', \"In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--\\nMrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--\\nevidently by the ingenuity of man.\", \"Other poultry-yards in the\\nneighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to\\nMr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense\\nof his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm\\nevery night of his life.\", 'The strength, resolution, and presence\\nof mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.', 'While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--\\nBut Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the\\nfirst week in November.', 'The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at\\nthe moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was\\ncalled on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert\\nMartin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.', 'The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties\\nhave no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the\\nparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,\\nand very inferior to her own.--\"Very little white satin, very few\\nlace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she\\nheard of it.\"', '--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,\\nthe hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band\\nof true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered\\nin the perfect happiness of the union.',
